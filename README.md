## Hello There!

My name is Maazin, and I am a fairly beginner programmer who currently works within IT (as of 2021) at a highschool in Maldives.
I am still learning my way around programming and also using GitHub in general.

### What I Do

Other than playing video games, I eventually plan to learn to make video games.
But currently I am doing small projects mostly through college assignments and projects assigned to me by my school.

I also do some YouTube Videos (gaming) in my spare time.

### Hit me up on twitter if you need to talk, I guess
